  First, call a `brew update` to get the latest Formula infos.
  It might be a good idea to call `brew doctor` as well and
  fix the listed issues if any.

  After this you can call `bitrise run -p brew_publish.yml edit-formula`.
  This'll open the `bitrise` brew formula in the specified Editor.

  Update the tool versions (bitrise, stepman, envman) and save the file.

  Run `bitrise run -p brew_publish.yml reinstall` to make sure the specified
  versions do work.

  Last but not least, to run a brew audit and issue checking on the Formula
  you should call: `bitrise run -p brew_publish.yml check`.

  *NOTE*: you might have to temporarily remove the GOPATH/bin from your
  PATH while calling `brew test`, as it might conflict with how
  `brew test` runs - the GOPATH/bin might become higher priority in PATH
  than the bitrise version brew tests!
