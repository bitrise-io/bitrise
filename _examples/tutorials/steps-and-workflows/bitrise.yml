  basics:
    # You can run this workflow with:
    # bitrise run basics
    #
    # All of the following steps in this workflow will do exactly the
    #  same thing, it demonstrates how you can define a step's ID
    #  in different ways.
    steps:
      # If you use a step from a step collection / library then
      #  a step's ID consists of three parts:
      # 1. The step-lib source
      # 2. The step's ID in the step-lib
      # 3. The step's version, registered in the step-lib
      # A full ID looks like this:
      # step-lib-source::step-id@version

              #/bin/bash
              echo "Welcome to Bitrise!"
      # If you define a default_step_lib_source (just like you can see it
      #  at the top of this bitrise.yml file) then you don't have to
      #  specify it again for the steps if you want to use
      #  the default_step_lib_source
      # You can include the :: separator or if you want to you can remove it
      #  completely.

      # If you want to use the latest version of the step
      #  you can even remove the version from the ID.
      # Once again you can include the separator (@ for the version)
      #  but you can remove it completely.
      # Note that the trailing colon is still required, even
      #  if you don't specify the version!

  direct-url:
    # You can run this workflow with:
    # bitrise run direct-url
    #
    # This workflow shows how to use steps with specifying the
    #  step's git clone URL directly.
    # This way the step will always be git cloned from the specified
    #  URL and not used from a step library/collection.
    # To do this you have to construct the ID in this way:
    #  git::git-clone-url-of-the-step-repo@branch-or-tag
    steps:
      - script:

              echo "ISO_DATETIME: ${ISO_DATETIME}"

  relative:
    # You can run this workflow with:
    # bitrise run relative
    #
    # You can specify local path for a step as well.
    # The path can be any kind of path (even absolute path)
    #  but the best way is to use relative paths
    #  if you want to run your workflow on a Continuous Integration
    #  service or want to share with someone else. Absolute paths
    #  and relative-to-home paths most likely won't work anywhere
    #  else except on your machine.
    # To do this you have to construct the ID in this way:
    #  path::local-path-of-the-step-folder
    steps:
      - script:
          title: "ok"
      - path::./steps-timestamp:
          title: "relative_pth-stamp-test"
      - script:

              #/bin/bash
              set -e
              echo "ISO_DATETIME: ${ISO_DATETIME}"

  local:
    # You can run this workflow with:
    # bitrise run local
    #
    # This is the same as the 'relative' workflow example
    #  just demonstrating that you can use all the common
    #  patterns to define the path of the step.
    # You can define even absolute paths but keep in mind
    #  that if you do it most likely won't work at someone,
    #  or on your Continuous Integration service (like your favorite Bitrise.io)
