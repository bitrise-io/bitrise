**Note:** this step's end-to-end tests (defined in `e2e/bitrise.yml`) are working with secrets which are intentionally not stored in this repo. External contributors won't be able to run those tests. Don't worry, if you open a PR with your contribution, we will help with running tests and make sure that they pass.
